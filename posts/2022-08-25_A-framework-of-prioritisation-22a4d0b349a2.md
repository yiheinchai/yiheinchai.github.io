A framework of prioritisation
The hierarchy goes like this:
A framework of prioritisationThe hierarchy goes like this:PeopleTimeMoneyIt is always worth it to sacrifice a lower ranked item for a higher ranked one. For example, spend time on people but not use people to get money. Spend money to buy time but not spend time to get money. In this concept, people includes oneself, and hence it is worth spending both time and money on yourself.Note that it is possible that having a salaried job will violate this rule because it consists of spending time to get money. However, this does not always have to be the case. Find a job that you are passionate about and you love doing even without the money. If you find innate job and happiness in your job, then ‘working’ is actually spending time on yourself. Money is simply a byproduct.People is an intentionally broad term. Obviously, not everyone is worth your time and this requires a level of self-judgement. But in general, it is not worth to sacrifice your friends so that you have more time, and even worse if you use that time to get money. That completely flips the order of precedence around.When hiring, you are spending money on people rather than finding people to save money. Not worth going cheap on your employees and always focus on their talents and hire based on that rather than based on price. In other words, pay well to get the best people on your team.
