Generators, Iterables and Iterators
Iterables and iterators
Generators, Iterables and IteratorsIterables and iteratorsThe for loop calls the __iter__() method on the iterable which returns an iterator object.The iterator object contains implementations of __iter__ method which returns self. And __next__ method which does the looping logic such as so:index+= 1return data_of_iterable[index]The for loop takes the iterator object, and calls __next__. The for loop takes the value returned from the __next__ method and sets that value as the for loop variable (ie. item | for item in items)The for loop then runs the code block within the for loop.Afterwards, the for loop then calls the __next__ method again and again until the stop condition is reached.GeneratorsAction of Generators in a for loopA generator is similar to the iterator object in that it has implementations of __iter__ and __next__ method. The __iter__ method returns self.The for loop calls the __iter__ method on the generator, returning self (the generator).The for loop calls the __next__ method, which does the looping logic such as so:current += 1return currentAfterwards, the for loop then calls the __next__ method again and again until the stop condition is reached.Creating generatorsIt is possible to create a generator object manually by implementing a class with the __iter__ and __next__ method.For example:However, a faster way to create a generator object is to simply use the ‘yield’ keyword in a function. The following demonstrates the use of ‘yield’ keyword and the generator object it creates under the hood.Crossover between iterables and generatorsRealising that the iterator object is rather similar to a generator object, we can have a custom implementation of the __iter__ method which returns a generator object instead of a iterator object and the iterable would still work the same.
