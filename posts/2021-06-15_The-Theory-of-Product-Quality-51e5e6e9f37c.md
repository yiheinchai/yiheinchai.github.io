What does it mean to make a good product? In this article, I present the factors that contribute to perceived product quality and how it relates to product development spend.

Graphical Representation of Theory of Product Quality
Building a product starts with trying to solve a practical problem.

For example, if a person wants to split an apple in half. The problem is that the person’s hands are incapable of doing so. Hence, the product will come in the form of a knife. The knife solves this practical problem by enabling humans to focus the forces applied by the hand to a single point, hence enabling them to cut the apple.

The theory of product quality can be represented in the form of a graph, where the Y-axis is the perceived product quality and the X-axis is the amount of money/resources spent developing the product. The line graph shows how total dollars spent on building the product correlates the eventual perceived product quality.

In the example above regarding the knife, the product will sit somewhere in the middle of the blue curve, denoted by the red point as “Apple Cutter V1”. The product possesses the core functionality of being able to cut an apple in half. It solves the core and practical problem.

Now, if additional dollars were poured in to further develop the knife, the knife may become larger, sharper, longer — making it even easier and faster to cut the apple in half. Therefore, the red dot position of “Apple Cutter V2” will shift upwards and rightwards from “Apple Cutter V1”.

Now, if even more money is poured into the development of this “Apple Cutter”, we can potentially use stronger metals to make the knife, maybe even use diamond to create the most durable knife edge. However, with those improvements, it barely improves the perceived product quality. Why? Because the practical problem that needs to be solve is simply to cut the apple in half. Having these fancy (diamond edged knife) is just excessive.

Therefore, on the graph, with even more development dollars spent, we see diminishing returns on perceived product quality. There is not much practical value we can increase in our product.

However, it is at this point of inflexion (on the graph) where we transitioning to improving the less practical aspects of the product. We are transitioning to cater to the emotional mind of the user.

With even more development dollars spent, we can possibly hire designers and craftsmen to engrave custom designs and artworks on the knife. These engravings on the knife does not help to solve the practical problem (of cutting the apple in half). Rather, it caters to the emotional mind of the user. It makes the user feel better when using the product. It makes the user happier and more fulfilled.

Now, trying to map “Apple Cutter V3” on the graph,

Apple Cutter V3 Mapped on the Graph
By now, focusing on catering to the emotional mind of the user with our product, we open up a whole new world of possibilities. Therefore, we can see that “Apple Cutter V3” is now on the exponential increment portion of the yellow graph.

Now, if even more money is poured into product development, we can invite a world famous artist of design the knife. At this point in time, this knife would become more of an art form, where the artist designing the knife may focus on providing a form of “catharsis” to the user. The merits of this art form can no longer be derived from visual observation, but only from our emotional senses. As with all art forms, it can range from simple to highly abstract art. Highly abstract art caters to our deepest-subconscious senses. However, when it is so deep in the sub-conscious realm, not everyone has the degree of sensitivity or appreciation of these types of abstract art.

Mapping “Apple Cutter V4” on the graph, with move further rightwards and upwards on the yellow graph.

It is important to notice here that we now at again at the point of diminishing returns. Diving too deep into the sub-conscious realm when designing this apple cutter may not be appreciated by everyone. Therefore, the perceived quality “Apple Cutter V4” lies is evidently lower than its intended quality (shown by the dotted line).

Deep in the sub-conscious realm is highly subjective. Therefore, the perceived value of the product cannot be generalized by a single graph. Some may view the product as a masterpiece, while others may view it is disgusting. It is this volatility in perceived value of the deep-sub-conscious realm that presents risks to a company. If a company intends to mass produce a product and cater to the masses, it would not be wise to dive too deep within in sub-conscious realm. Rather, the company should find a key sweet spot where the perceived quality is the highest given the product development dollars spent.

While the examples given of “Apple Cutter V1,2,3,4” may be trivial, it gives us key insights into how the world’s biggest tech companies operate.

Apple Inc. is an example of a company that fully understands this concept and have utilized it to create products loved by the users of 1.4 billion Apple devices around the world. Apple Inc. is known to carry an extreme attention to detail on their products. They fuss of the smallest things and spends lots of product development dollars to reach the “Apple standard” they hold themselves to.

For example, AirPower, a cancelled Apple product, was a wireless charging mat. However, rather than building a simple wireless charger, they decided to make a wireless charger which can charge your device anywhere on the mat. It may seem that the feature of being to place your device anywhere on the mat is trivial. This is especially because this “feature” does not in anyway improve its ability to solve the practical problem — to charge your devices. And yet, Apple spent years developing this product, pouring in significant product development dollars to make the feature work. Why? Because Apple recognizes that their products should provide more than just practical value. They want their products to cater to the emotional mind. They want their users to feel at ease, to feel good using their products. More than anything, Apple products are more art, than tech.

Therefore, for the many many product developers today and of the future, it is my hope that you too will recognize this. Solving the practical and functional problem is important, but doing so is only half the battle. The other half of perceived value of a product lies in the sub-conscious realm.

In the society that places increasing emphasis of the practical math and sciences, it is easy for people to discount the importance of the arts. But what many do not realize is that the arts is imbued in everything in the world. Life is the interaction between humans and the environment. While the math and sciences seeks to explain and understand our environment, the arts seeks to cater to us as human beings. As long as humans continue to exist and continue to use products, we must incorporate art in the products that we build.

Product Development Process
The product development process should look something like the figure above. We start by observing the environment in our own lens. We identify a problem, go into that environment and create a product to solve the problem. Having solved the problem, we than go into the humanity realm to think about the second challenge: how can our product cater to it’s human user? We think about the sub-conscious realm and think about how to cater to the emotional mind.

I hope with my above examples, I have successfully dissected and cut Apple’s product philosophy apart, to help you understand how Apple makes great products loved by people all around the world.

And I hope that you will utilize the theory of product quality to produce phenomenal products that will delight the world.
