The future of research isÂ virtualResearch of the future will be fully digital. Current research is too slow and expensive.One of the biggest problems in modern biological research is the lack of ability to visually observe what is going on the chemical level and on the cellular level.To solve this problem, we can work towards to create a virtual model of the human bodies with AI. For a novel drug, we simply apply the treatment to the virtual body and pan and zoom in to see what is happening in the virtual world.The virtual human body should be generated based on fundamental principles and axioms.
