## Legend

Red represents basic cognitive function to respond to stimulus. Light blue represents imaginative,Creative, and random thoughts. This is the most useful area where a balance between imaginativeness and practicality is kept in balance. Dark blue represents R.E.M. Dreams, where thoughts are even more erratic and doesn't make sense. Black is deep sleep, where there are no thoughts at all. 


Red arrow represents external stimuli. The external stimuli suppresses sleep and imaginative thoughts. The stronger the external stimuli, the more suppressed it gets, until the point it snuffs out one Colour completely. The snuffing out is the phenomenon of waking up, and also zoning out and back in(absent minded). This phenomenon is represented by the graph in the intersections. 


Yellow arrow extreme external stimuli that is capable of inducing stress reactions which involves body's production of hormones. It eats into the red area as stress is capable of affecting your basic cognitive function. The snuffing out region of red area would cause you to lose all basic cognitive function. Meaning you can't think or move. I'm not sure what actually happens but it can either non-serious, like stress coma, or semi-serious like complete mental breakdown, or it can be very serious like loss of sense of humanity. Maybe a link to trauma patients?


So to find out where you are at now, draw a verticals line (eg. Y=3) where the vertical line lies depends on the amount of external stimuli you think you are receiving. Where you are at now is the first intersection counting from TOP to bottom. 


Relation to what we observe in life:
The most efficient and useful point would be the intersection between dark blue and light blue. Right before you fall into sleep, you maximise you imaginative power. You can observe that at this point, a lot of the light blue area can't be utilised for human work as it is covered by sleep. So to increase the human potential, you either, 1) force the dark blue and black area to recede 2) smoothen out the external force

## Legend: 
Orange arrow represents enlightenment, being truly free. Grey area represents a connection to a high-being (created by humans, ie god) God serves as a vessel for humans to connect to the light grey area easily.


Light grey. Area. This area is the most powerful. It is the connection between space-time the comprehension of the 4th dimension. Therefore, by harnessing this state, one harnesses time. A very weak form of this, lies on the edge of the light grey area and very close to the grey area. In life, these are the dreams that have predictive value, that are premonitions that come true despite the incredibly Low probability. I said it is close to grey area because people associate this with a connection with god. 

The light grey area allows one to comprehend the 4th dimension, in human's  3 dimensional world. This is done through dreams, where scenarios are presented in 3s. Some dreams don't come true because space time is fluid 


Notice a pattern on the graph. The center, horizontal midline ( ie dark blue region) is where personal brain activity is at the maximum, the greatest output from the brain. Moving away from this center, you either get further away from reality or closer to reality. When you go further away from reality, your brain activity decreases to a point where you stop producing informAtion and instead you start receiving information, about space-time, future etc. When you go nearer to reality, your brain production activity does down to a point where you only take in information with no processing (like what animals do) 


The smarter the being and more divine the being is, the higher the resting state. For example a very great being would have a resting state in the light grey area (actually for them, they would be a 4d being, that means they would be at the bottom of the 4d spectrum instead, it is actually a vertically repeating graph). For example a very shitty being would have a resting state at the bottom of the red (ie stupid organisms). Human average lie in the light blue area but closer to the red when awake. And average lie in the dark blue area closer to the black when asleep.



Humans would forever think they are the best creature cos they are able to experience most of the 3D spectrum (while some animals only experience red). However they are unaware of the numerous greater beings above them. This is due to the dimension barrier forming incommensurbility between dimensions. Humans can never see or understand a 4d being or a 2 d being
